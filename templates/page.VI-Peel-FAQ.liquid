          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Everyone’s skin is a little different, and the number of peels needed for desired results varies from person to person, and from skin condition to skin condition. While just a single peel will achieve significant skin rejuvenation (think less pigment, smoother skin texture, and brighter, glowier skin overall), in general, we recommend a series of 3-6 peels for optimal results. Make sure to consult with your healthcare professional to find a VI Peel treatment frequency that’s right for you.</p>

However, there are a few contraindications that disqualify you from receiving the VI Peel. Please note that the below list is not an extensive list, and we always recommend you consult your healthcare professional before starting any new skincare regimen or treatment.

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">The VI Peel does not burn! You may experience slight warmness and tingling in the beginning, but this should quickly subside. Besides the warmness and tingling, VI Peel treatments are virtually painless.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Eyebrow threading can be done 10-14 days before or after a VI Peel treatment. We allow this time frame for the skin to heal and prevent irritation. </p>

        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">If a series is recommended, the VI Peel is suitable to receive every 4-6 weeks as directed by your Practitioner. Your Practitioner will be able to create your own unique skincare plan for your skincare needs. You can also have the VI Peels quarterly/seasonally and receive 4 peels a year for the maintenance of healthy skin.</p>

        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Yes, the practitioner just needs to apply a barrier ointment to avoid lifting the pigment. The VI Peel can be done 10-14 days after new microblading, or when the skin has fully healed.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Purging or experiencing mild acne breakouts after getting a VI Peel is completely normal. This type of acne purging can happen after any exfoliating treatment, as the treatment increases cellular turnover, not only lifting dead skin cells but also allowing for any congestion that is trapped beneath the skin to come to the surface. It's important to remember that your acne may seem to get worse before getting better, and you may need multiple VI Peel treatments to resolve your acne. Purging of the skin will reduce with subsequent peels as congested pores become cleared. In between treatments, we recommend using products that help further increase cellular turnover, like VI Derm Retinol Age-Defying Treatment Moisturizer.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">In general, you can expect to start peeling on or around day three and peel for about three to four days afterward. Each person’s peeling experience is a little different, and some may peel for more or fewer days, depending on the condition of the skin. If this is your first VI Peel, it’s also normal to peel for a longer period of time.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">There are many reasons why you may not see the peeling. Even if you can’t see something with the naked eye, the VI Peel is still working for you and exfoliating at the cellular level to brighten and improve your skin’s appearance. If you have further questions or concerns, we highly recommend you return to your Practitioner.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Do not pull back on the skin that is shedding. It is recommended to use a clean, small cuticle scissor to trim the exfoliating skin. You can also wash the face very gently to help remove the hanging skin but be sure to not rub excessively. If washing the face multiple times a day, be sure to add moisture back to the skin by applying the Post Treatment Repair Cream (or Aquaphor if very dry). Don’t forget to use the VI Derm SPF 50+ to protect the skin during and after the exfoliation process.</p>

        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">After the VI Peel solution is applied to the skin, no makeup or any topical products can be applied for the first 4 hours, including sunscreen! At the 4 hour mark, you can apply makeup after you've completed the "Four Hour Post Treatment" steps.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">We advise against using your regular moisturizers on the skin for the full exfoliation process, as it may have alcohol content or other ingredients that we do not want to damage the skin as it is preparing for peeling and shedding.  We recommend that you stick to the products in your post-care kit only for a full week.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">You should refrain from exercising for 72-96 hours after receiving the VI Peel to prevent any blistering in the skin or Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH). If prone to PIH or with pigment damage/melasma it is suggested to refrain for the entire 7-day peeling process so as not to induce heat or inflammation in the skin that can lead to further damage.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">You want to avoid direct and extreme sun exposure for the first 7 days.  Make sure you’re applying your VI Derm SPF 50 Sunscreen (provided in your Aftercare Kit) every morning. Also note that lifestyle sun exposure, like running errands, going for a walk, walking your dog, grabbing coffee, and driving, are all fine, as long as you are protecting your skin from the sun by wearing SPF and wearing a hat.</p>

        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">If you're still experiencing dryness and flakiness 7 days after your VI Peel treatment, we recommend you use a hydrating moisturizer to help alleviate dryness, like CeraVe or Cetaphil moisturizer available at your local drug store.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Yes, you would still apply your post peel towelettes as instructed, except you would avoid the areas that have already peeled. For example, most people start peeling around their mouth. If the area around your mouth is peeling, simply apply your post peel towelette everywhere except around your mouth.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Don’t panic! You did not ruin your peel. The main goal of the post peel towelettes is to help speed up the peeling process, as well as maximize your results from the peel. Our main goal is for you to apply all the towelettes provided within 48 hours of receiving the VI Peel. Forgot to apply your first post peel towelette 4 hours after your treatment? No worries! Simply apply your first post peel towelette on night one, then shift your night one instruction to the morning after. Used the towelettes in the wrong order (only for Purify, Precision Plus, & Purify with Precision Plus peels)? No worries! Simply use what you have left during your next post peel towelette application. For example, if you used your Purify towelette before your Precision Plus towelette, it is okay. Just wait the full 20 minutes before applying the Precision Plus towelette.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Yes! Not only do the post-peel towelettes provide more acne, pigment, and age fighting ingredients; they are also designed to help speed up the cell turnover process, helping your skin to peel faster and peel more, maximizing the results you may get from the VI Peel. Because the towelettes help your skin peel faster, they are also helping to minimize your downtime, speeding up the time from peel application to glowing skin results. If you skip the towelettes, your peeling process may be prolonged or minimized.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">If you received your VI Peel in the evening, you would still apply your first Post Peel Towelette four hours after the treatment - this will likely be right before bed. Then, move your night one instructions to the next morning (day two). When you wake up on day two, follow the instructions from night one, then follow with a layer of SPF 50+ from the kit. After this, you can resume your post-peel aftercare & towelettes normally, as night two instructions state.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Even on skin that may be normally oily, winter can often result in dryer skin during the post peel process. When experiencing these types of side effects, it is always best to consult with your healthcare provider to find a solution that works best for your skin. We typically recommend using a gentle hydrating cleanser, like the VI Derm Gentle Purifying Cleanser or Cetaphil, and using an occlusive balm like Aquaphor in addition to the Post Treatment Repair Cream (included in your Aftercare Kit). Don’t forget to drink lots of water!</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Some itching during the peeling process is completely normal, and some may experience greater itchiness than others, particularly in the evening. This is also normal. Itchiness is also typically seen more frequently in dry or mature skin types. When itchiness occurs, apply a thin layer of the Post Treatment Repair Cream provided in your kit as needed. If you feel the Post Treatment Repair Cream is not helping, consult your practitioner. They may recommend you upgrade to a stronger hydrocortisone cream, which requires a prescription.</p>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-plus faq-button"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Yes, it is normal to experience itching on the first night of your VI Peel treatment. You may apply the Post Treatment Repair anti-itch Cream to your skin throughout the night. Avoid scratching your skin. You may take an over-the-counter antihistamine blocker if recommended by your provider.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="faq-text" style="max-height: 0px;">Redness and dryness are signs that your skin needs a gentle and soothing moisturizer or balm. In addition to the Post Treatment Repair Cream, you can also include Aquaphor to help heal the irritated skin. Aquaphor is a barrier ointment and does not replace the need for the Post Treatment Repair Cream. It is always best to contact your practitioner and allow them to assess your skin needs.</p>
